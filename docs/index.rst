SimPEG (Simulation and Parameter Estimation in Geophysics) is a python
package for simulation and gradient based parameter estimation in the
context of geoscience applications.

The vision is to create a package for finite volume simulation and parameter estimation with
applications to geophysical imaging and subsurface flow. To enable
these goals, this package has the following features:

* is modular with respect to discretization, physics, optimization, and regularization
* is built with the (large-scale) inverse problem in mind
* provides a framework for geophysical and hydrogeologic problems
* supports 1D, 2D and 3D problems
